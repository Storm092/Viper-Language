# Environment
The Build-in editor is not the best one. For a reason. If you have an issue that it doesnt work at all its probably cause its poorly formatted so put spaces in the lines
and then drag it on the Compiler. I'd prefer mine but if you're going to write alot of code using viper i would say you should use Vsc.
